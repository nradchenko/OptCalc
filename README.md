OptCalc
=======

This tool is a part of the coursework I wrote in 2015 using Qt Creator (3.5 or 3.6 most likely).

The main task of the program is to calculate the maximum fiber link distance given fiber type, wavelength, spectrum width and most of loss budget terms.

Feel free to use this as a skeleton for a program that does a similar task. Note that most of the captions and tooltips are in Russian.
